## üìù Agenda

1.Introduction
- Introduce the topic of analysis and the application of Linear Regression
- Explain the objective of this study (e.g., prediction or finding the relationship between variables like height and weight)

2.Theory and Concept
- Explain the principles of Linear Regression and the Least Squares Method (LSM)
- Calculation of regression coefficients from the linear regression equation
- Polynomial regression for improving prediction accuracy

3.Code Implementation
- Import libraries and prepare sample data (e.g., using NumPy and Matplotlib)
- Create the data matrix and calculate coefficients using matrix multiplication
- Plot the Linear Regression and Polynomial Fit graphs for comparison

4.Results and Discussion
- Display the results obtained from calculating the coefficients
- Explain the graphs and how weight is predicted from height
- Analyze the results and discuss the accuracy of the predictions

5.Conclusion
- Summarize the experiment and the use of Linear Regression for predicting quantitative data
- Provide suggestions for applying this method to other data predictions
